# What is this repo?
Somewhere to keep my custom Streamer.bot commands, all commands are for Streamer.bot v1.0.0+.

# What can I find here?

## Check-In Sound Bands
Allows you play different sounds depending on how many check-ins a user has

## Quote Search
Allows users to search for quotes by string

## Reward Leaderboard
Do you have a daily check-in? This will output a table of the top x redeemers

## SFX Manager
A low effort SFX Manager, just dump your file.mp3 into a folder you define, populate the list, and then you can use it with `!file`
